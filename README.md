# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis

> **Note:** This README is a template. Please replace the placeholder content with details specific to your `netflix-movies-analysis` project, adding specifics about your data sources, analysis techniques, and findings.

## Description

This project analyzes the dataset of movies and TV shows available on Netflix. It explores various aspects like content trends, popularity analysis based on release year, country of origin, ratings, and genre distribution. The goal is to provide insights into the Netflix content library, identify trends, and potentially offer suggestions for content creators.

> Expand on this description by adding details about the specific questions you're trying to answer with your analysis, the types of visualizations you're creating, and any unique insights you've discovered.

## Installation

Describe the steps required to install and set up the project. Include any dependencies that need to be installed. If there are any specific environment requirements, document them clearly.

1.  Clone the repository:

        > Replace `main.py` with the actual name of your main script or notebook (e.g., `netflix_analysis.ipynb`). If using a Jupyter Notebook:

        > Describe any configuration files or command-line arguments needed to run the project. For example:
    > If you are using an API, you need to add your API key. If you are using a local data source, you need to define the location of the data.
